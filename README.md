### NLP and CSS 2017: Second Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science at ACL 2017

Here we provide a dataset of tweets that were annotated for detecting benevolent sexism.

The file `benevolent_sexist.tsv` contains Tweet ID's of tweets that exhibit benevolent sexism.
The file `hostile_sexist.tsv` contains Tweet ID's of tweets that are hostile in nature. The hostile sexist tweets
were part of the Hate Speech Dataset (Waseem and Hovy, 2016).
